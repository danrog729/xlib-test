# xlib-test

This is a place for me to dump my code relating to experimentation with the XLib library. I'm doing so in order to help gain a better understanding of how windows and applications work on the lowest levels. The binaries work on Linux (ubuntu definitely, idk with any other distros) by just doing ```./\[FILE-NAME\]```. If you want to compile it yourself for whatever reason you need to make sure you have a library that gives you access to Xlib.h. On Ubuntu that's just ```sudo apt install libx11-dev```.
